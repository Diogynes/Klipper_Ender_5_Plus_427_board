# Klipper_Ender_5_Plus_Creality_427_board

This printer configuration file is for a Creality 4.2.7 board installed in an Ender 5 Plus printer.

Note: This configuration uses the dedicated 5-pin header on the Creality 4.2.7 board to connect a BLTouch. The BLTouch 
did not work with the sensor wires connected to the Z-endstop.
